    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
   Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, widely known as the "People's President" and the "Missile Man of India," was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. An accomplished aerospace engineer, Kalam played a pivotal role in India's civilian space program and military missile development. His visionary leadership and contributions to India's defense capabilities, especially as the project director for the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) and the successful test firing of the Agni and Prithvi missiles, earned him national acclaim. In 2002, he became the 11th President of India, serving with humility and simplicity. Driven by a passion for education, he continued to inspire and mentor students, emphasizing the importance of science and technology for national development. Abdul Kalam's legacy extends beyond his scientific achievements, as he remains a symbol of wisdom, integrity, and dedication to the progress of his nation. His popular books, motivational speeches, and enduring influence make him an iconic figure in Indian history. Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, but his spirit lives on, inspiring generations to come.
